> ### DISCLAIMER
> **IMPORTANT:** The current state of this application is **BETA**, because we are constantly evolving towards newly released technologies. Therefore, many areas could be improved and change significantly while refactoring the current code and implementing new features. Feedback with improvements and pull requests from the community will be highly appreciated and accepted.

> This reference application proposes a simplified microservice oriented architecture implementation to introduce technologies like .NET Core with Docker containers through a comprehensive application. The chosen domain is eSchool/Online Scchool administration software but simply because it is a well-known domain by most people/developers.
However, this sample application should not be considered as an "School administration or management software" at all. The implemented business domain might not be ideal from an School administration or management point of view. It is neither trying to solve all the problems in a large, scalable and mission-critical distributed system. It is just a bootstrap for developers to easily get started in the world of Docker containers and microservices with .NET Core.
